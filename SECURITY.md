## 🐞 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in this project, **please do not open a public issue**.

Instead, follow these steps:

1. **Report privately** by emailing: `omersdg23@outlook.com`  

2. Include as much detail as possible:
   - Version affected
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact

3. We aim to:
   - Respond within **14 days**
   - Issue a patch if needed and give public credit (if desired)

## 🔐 Handling Timeline

Once a vulnerability is reported:
- It will be investigated immediately.
- If verified, a patch will be prepared.
- A new release will be published ASAP.
- You’ll be informed throughout the process.

## ✅ General Security Notes

- Always keep your **keys safe**.
- This app uses `AES-GCM`, `ECC`, and secure random generation via `secrets` and `os.urandom()`.
- Your private key is never sent or shared anywhere. It's your responsibility to keep it protected.
